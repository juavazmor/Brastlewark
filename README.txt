* External libraries used

- 'Alamofire'
The most famous networking library out there for Swift. Used because it simplifies all the HTTP-based requests complexity to the minimum and it does it in a really "swifty" elegant way.


- 'SDWebImage'
It's a library that allows asynchronous image downloading and cache support out of the box. It was used to download and chache the gnomes' profile thumbnails


- 'SwiftRangeSlider'
Custom "range slider" used to filter gnomes between certain values (i.e. age, weight and height). I could have written mine but thought that I would have included unnecessary bugs and it would have also slowed the development of the test app.
